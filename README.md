# button-creator

A program that generates a texture of a button based on a configuration file.  
I created it with the goal of generating button textures for a game I was making, but I ended up abandoning the game.

## Using

Edit [`./config.h`](./config.h). Then compile with the following command:
```console
$ make
```
The generated texture will be `button.png`.
